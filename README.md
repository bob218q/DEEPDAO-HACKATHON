NFT representation of the DAO

In this series of NFT I wanted to represent elements that correspond to actions and the philosophy behind the DAO.
Each element is made up of interconnections just what happens within the movements/organizations DAO.
Interconnections of economic resources and of innovative ideas but in a decentralized world.

* DAO DEBATES -> It represents the debates (conversations) within the DAO community.
* DAO IDEAS -> It represents the ideas behind the DAO project.
* DECISION PROCESS -> It represents the decision-making and development process of the DAO.
* GROWTH OF THE DAO -> It represents the growth of the value of the DAO and its token.
* LEADER CHOICES -> It represents the choices of DAO leaders in making decisions for the future of the DAO.
* UNITY -> It represents the unity of the members and the synthesis of ideas that must be achieved to develop a DAO project as a whole.
